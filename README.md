NewOrleans.html 
    Web page describing the city of New Orleans.  
    Links to nolaThingsToDo.html created by me.
    Other links will take you to the original NewOrleans website neworleans.com
    
    From this page you can signup for our fictional newsletter by providing your name and email.  
    Submit action uses the javascript subscribe.js

subscribe.js
    The javascript takes the input name and email and saves to a comma separated file named signup.csv.  
    Saving the file is wip, currently just pops up a message confirming that they are subscribed.
