# Assignment02: Github
Making improvements to Vikram Gupta's Assignment 1.
(https://github.com/vgupta117/assignment01)

*Layout: I think the navigation bar before is a little confusing since most of them will take you to the original recourses websites. There are only two pages that are created by Vikram. Therefore, I created a new section for these "Other Helpful Links" and move them into the content section. I think it makes the navigation clearer and more understandable. Also, I move the resource links to the right cornor of each picture, which makes the webpage look more compact. Readers will be less likely to be disrupted by the source links.

*Embellishments: I changed the color of the title bar to violet and changed some font-styles. It looks more fancy and fits my impression to New Orleans. Besides, I cropped the banner and adjust the saturation of some pictures, which are more vibrant. I still keep the background color white in order to keep the website simple and more readable for the viewers.
